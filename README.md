The goal of this project was to develop a robust backend API for an e-learning platform. The API facilitated user registration, user profile management, and course management (including CRUD operations for superadmin), and, the courses API  implemented filtering to enhance user experience. The backend is created using node.js and express.js data is stored in MongoDB
